# Gamecraft (portfolio website)

This is a static website for a fictional videogame creation tool called *Gamecraft*. This imaginary program runs on Windows, and allows anyone to create a videogame though a fully visual interface rather than by writing lines of code. An asset store with a wealth of free content is also available, so the user doesn't need to be a visual artist or sound designer either. All that's needed is an idea and a bit of effort.
