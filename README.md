# Gamecraft: a portfolio website

This is a static website for a fictional videogame creation tool called *Gamecraft*. This imaginary program runs on Windows, and allows anyone to create a videogame though a fully visual interface rather than by writing lines of code. An asset store with a wealth of free content is also available, so the user doesn't need to be a visual artist or sound designer either. All that's needed is an idea and a bit of effort.

## Motivation

Most people who play videogames want to create one themselves at some point. However, the need to learn a programming language and use complicated engines discourages the majority of them from ever giving it a try. Even tools meant for less technical users often overwhelm beginners with countless menus and buttons, and can only be deciphered through persistence and video tutorials. There is a market gap for a program which focuses on learnability as its core principle, and this is the gap that Gamecraft aims to fill.
