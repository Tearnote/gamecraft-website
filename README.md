# Gamecraft: a portfolio website

This is a static website for a fictional videogame creation tool called *Gamecraft*. This imaginary program runs on Windows, and allows anyone to create a videogame though a fully visual interface rather than by writing lines of code. An asset store with a wealth of free content is also available, so the user doesn't need to be a visual artist or sound designer either. All that's needed is an idea and a bit of effort.

## Motivation

Most people who play videogames want to create one themselves at some point. However, the need to learn a programming language and use complicated engines discourages the majority of them from ever giving it a try. Even tools meant for less technical users often overwhelm beginners with countless menus and buttons, and can only be deciphered through persistence and video tutorials. There is a market gap for a program which focuses on learnability as its core principle, and this is the gap that Gamecraft aims to fill.

## Market research

There are a few established competitors in this field, such as:

 - [Construct](https://www.construct.net/en), an simple videogame creation tool that runs in the browser,
 - [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com), an engine for grid-based RPG games,
 - [Game Maker](https://gamemaker.io/en), a graphical 2D game creation program,
 - [Unity](https://unity.com/solutions/game), a powerful engine for high-end multimedia games and applications,
 - [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US), an engine powering cutting edge graphics and digital worlds.

Their websites are generally modern and attractive while maintaining conventional UX. As a result, they're easy to parse for facts and the user is smoothly guided through product features to the call to action. Because their designs all follow the same principles and they are transparent about product features rather than trying to attract users with meaningless slogans and buzzwords, the sites feel reliable and the products are easy to compare against each other.

In particular, the commonly seen page sections are:

 - Header with the major navigation links,
 - Hero image or background video of projects created with the product,
 - Early call to action above the fold,
 - Links to training material and online documentation,
 - Feature showcase with images or animations of the feature in action,
 - Gallery of the most popular games made with the tool,
 - Testimonials from successful users,
 - Pricing and licensing details split into product tiers with a feature matrix,
 - Links to community resources,
 - Large, non-sticky footer with more detailed navigation and business / legal details.
